# Action Recognition in Videos
Recognizing action being performed in Videos using Stacked Optical Flow and HOGHOF features. To be trained on UCF 101 database. The code in this
repository is based on the following papers:

- [Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199v2.pdf)
- [Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection](http://vc.cs.nthu.edu.tw/home/paper/codfiles/hkchiu/201205170946/Histograms%20of%20Oriented%20Gradients%20for%20Human%20Detection.pdf)

Some code is borrowed from this repository https://github.com/wadhwasahil/Video-Classification-2-Stream-CNN.git
